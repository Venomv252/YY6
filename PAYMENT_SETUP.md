## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
Make sure your backend server (`server.js`) is running on port 3000:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npm install
node server.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ Payment server running on http://localhost:3000
üìä Payment logs: E:\otptest\logs\payments.json
üîë Razorpay Key ID: rzp_test_S568pOBqgQbORV
üìù Environment: development
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Razorpay credentials:

```env
# Razorpay Configuration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_S568pOBqgQbORV
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=XDwEMiSKWNrlU14VkHBusdkq

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
```

**Note:** Copy the `env-template.txt` file to `.env` for the correct credentials.

```bash
cd YY
npm install
npm run dev
```

}
```

**Log Types:**

## Testing the Payment Flow

1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Navigate to internship form and submit
3. Click "Yes" to take the test
4. Click "Proceed to Test & Pay ‚Çπ500"
5. Complete payment using test card details
6. Verify access to test and quiz pages
7. Check admin dashboard for payment logs

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Working
- Check if backend server is running on port 3000
- Verify Razorpay keys in `.env` file
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure popup blockers are disabled
- Check payment logs in admin dashboard

### Cannot Access Test
- Clear localStorage and try payment again
- Check if payment was successful in Razorpay dashboard
- Verify payment verification endpoint is working
- Check payment logs for errors

### Admin Dashboard Issues
- Ensure backend server is running
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify all API endpoints are accessible

## Security Notes

- Payment verification happens on backend with signature validation
- Local storage is used for session management
- All payment activities are logged for audit trails
- Consider implementing server-side session management for production
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Regular monitoring of payment logs for suspicious activities

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

- Database integration for persistent storage
- Email notifications for successful payments
- User authentication and session management
- Advanced admin features (user management, analytics)
- Webhook integration for real-time updates
